      I am a software developer with a strong passion for DevOps and automation.
      
      Currently, I’m a Year 3 Information Security student at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
      
      Outside of school, I’m constantly learning. I’m working toward the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) certifications, and I regularly take online courses to keep up with evolving tools and workflows.

      Right now, I’m a DevOps Engineering Intern at Kiteworks (https://kiteworks.com) in Singapore. 
      
      This portfolio site is my first deep dive into tools like Terraform, Ansible, and GitHub Actions — and I’ve been loving every bit of it.

          I was a software developer at Seagate Technology (https://seagate.com) in Singapore. 
          I worked on a project that is used internally by test developers to help identify the dependencies between source files.

          - Generated a dependency graph using the following steps:
            - Documenting source code with open-source tool Doxygen
            - Parsing Doxygen output with Python 
            - Generated a dependency graph with object-oriented programming (OOP)

          - Created an interactive and report-styled frontend that enabled developers to query the affected tests with following technologies:
            - HTML
            - CSS
            - Javascript

          - Bridged frontend and backend graph using Flask

          Technologies used:
            - Python
            - HTML
            - CSS
            - JavaScript
            - Flask
            - Doxygen

          I took up H2 Computing, H2 Chemistry, H2 Mathematics and H1 Economics as my main subjects.

          It was during my study of H2 Computing when I grew the passion for coding.
          Python was the first language that I had learnt from then. I'm really glad I took on computing!
